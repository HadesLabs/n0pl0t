## FAQ
### How do I get n0pl0t releases?
n0pl0t releases will be available to download via [AnonFiles](https://anonfiles.com/). A streaming host has not yet been found. If enough demand is created, torrents will also be made available, however AnonFiles is fast and stable enough to the point where torrents shouldn't be necessary.

### What's the quality like?
n0pl0t releases are mostly created using downloads from [hanime.tv](https://hanime.tv). I download the maximum quality available, and the highest that can be downloaded with a free account is 720p. As of December 2021, only one h3ntai is not available in 720p because the download wouldn't work.

### Where are the releases sourced from?
Releases are sourced from [hanime.tv](https://hanime.tv). If a requested h3ntai is not available from hanime.tv, another source will be used.

### Are these censored?
When I personally pick a h3ntai to make a release from, I make sure that it's uncensored. Any requests made to me may or may not be uncensored. 

### Where can I find the original video?
The original videos of my releases are in a playlist at https://hanime.tv/playlists/cojcpditw8dgyvxnyvbh.

### Do you take requests?
Yes, simply DM on Discord at HadesButDiscord#4177. Your Discord username will be placed next to your request unless said otherwise. There's also basically nothing I won't do.

### Can I give you my hard earned money because you cut some plot out of a h3ntai?
Of course! Donation links can be found at https://github.com/HadesLabs/welcome#donate.
